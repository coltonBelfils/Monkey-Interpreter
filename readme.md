This is made by following the *Writing an interpreter in Go* book by Thorsten Ball.

The following additions have been added by me along the way:
- Added the modulus operator (%) to the four math operators the book users (+-*/)
- Added support comments, both single line (//) and multiline (/* */)
- Added support for multiline comments in the repl.
